title: Xcode 4 and git
---

I downloaded and installed the new Xcode yesterday to work out some ideas I
had and I found that it ships by default with git integration.

Click [here][gestures_ipad] to find out how to enable multitask gestures for
your iPad.

Turns out that after the installation process the package takes up about 10
gig on your hard drive but it includes all the earlier iOS version packages as
well.  When I started my new project Xcode asked me to put my files under GIT
version control. I was surprised about this integration and off course I
clicked yes. 

Xcode now works and integrates with [git][git_homepage] to keep your files
under version control. 

If you want to get started with git and you are working on Mac than this is
pretty straight forward.  Download the [git-osx-installer][git_installer] from
code.google.com

Now sit down and start reading on how to get started with git. This is an
excellent online book: [http://progit.org/book/][git_book]

title: Diving into iPhone Development

As a developer with some good and a lot of bad ideas piling up at the
imaginary pile, a couple of months ago I started exploring Apple's iPhone SDK.
So far so good.  I just wanted to share some good books about iPhone
development and the Objective-C language.

<!-- more -->

1. First of all: **Beginning iPhone Development** by
   [Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche][iphone_dev_link]
   published by [Apress.com][apress]

Guides you to the iPhone SDK and explains how developing for the iPhone
differs from developing for the Mac. Because I was well aware of the abstract
concepts of programming, Model View Controller, inheritance etcetera. This
book was very easy to read. Even with no experience in C, Objective-C or C++.

Because some basic concepts differ from other languages I used another book as
a reference while reading "Beginning iPhone Development".

2. That other book, also from [Apress.com][apress], is called
   **Learn Objective-C on the Mac** from
   [Mark Dalrymple and Scott Knaster][learn_obj_c_link].

A perfect reference guide when you have no experience in the C-family
language. And explains how certain things work in Objective-C. Very
interesting is Appendix A which covers a lot of other languages such as
Actionscript, php and Java and explains how a lot of things are similar but
different.

Until now it has only been tutorials, reading, copy/paste and more tutorials.
And as a big fan of the [PureMVC][puremvc] framework, which was
originally developed for Actionscript has now been ported to a lot of other
languages [including Objective-C][pmvc_objc].

Soon I'll be posting more about PureMVC on the iPhone
